## Installation
#### Installing on Windows
1.Download the latest version for Windows (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  ```sh
  pip help
  ```
If PIP responds, then PIP is installed. Otherwise, there will be an error saying the program could not be found.
Before installing PIP, download the get-pip.py file(https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py).
  ```bash
  curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
  ```


  ```python
  python get-pip.py
  ```
Once you’ve installed PIP, you can test whether the installation has been successful by typing the following:
  ```sh
  pip help
  ```
If PIP has been installed, the program runs, and you should see the location of the software package and a list of commands you can use with pip.

  pip install cmake

  pip install dlib
  ```
```sh
  pip install numpy
